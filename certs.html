<p> Here you will find MOOC certifications. I had a lot of fun going through
    these courses with Stanford's Andrew Ng. He's a phenomenal lecturer and
    I recommend his courses to anyone interested in machine learning.

    Thank you, Professor Ng!

<p> An 11 week course focused on the fundamentals and best practices of machine
    learning. Topics gone over fell under supervised and unsupervised learning.
    Implementation of statistical models such as support vector machines,
    linear regression, and k-means clustering done in MATLAB.

<p> A <i>deeper</i> dive into deep learning. This 20 week specialization taught
    me where and how deep learning was making an impact in the industry, the
    use of ceiling analysis in project management, model tuning with
    hyperparameters, and the different applications of convolutional neural
    networks and sequential models. Lessons were done in Python with TensorFlow
    and Keras.
